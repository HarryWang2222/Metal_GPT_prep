Unique precipitations  with core-shell  structure  between  metal and intermetallics  were ﬁrstly observed  
in zirconium  based alloy. The spherical  core structure  was identiﬁed  as tetragonal  Zr 3 Ge nanoprecipi-  
tate, and the shell structure  was determined  to be face-centered-cubic  (FCC) zirconium  phase, which uni- 
formly encircled  the Zr 3 Ge nanoparticle  while obeying  the orientation  relationship  with the hexagonal-  
close-packed  (HCP) zirconium  phase matrix: [1 1 0] FCC // [2 1 1 0] HCP and (1 1 1) FCC // (0 0 01) HCP . Based on 
electron  microscopy  characterization  and theoretical  analysis,  the formation  mechanism  of the core-shell  
structured  nanoprecipitates  was proposed.

Precipitation  hardening  has been widely implemented  in metal- 
lic structural  materials,  such as Aluminum,  Magnesium,  Nickel, Ti- 
tanium  and Zirconium  alloys. These strengthening  particles  of dis- 
similar  compositions  or crystalline  structures  impede  the move- 
ment of dislocations  or other defects  in the crystal’s  lattice. Mean- 
while, extra interfaces  were produced,  which actually  act similarly  
as grain boundaries.  For example,  it was ﬁrstly observed  in Al-Li- 
Zr alloy that Al 3 Zr precipitates  can serve as heterogeneous  nucle- 
ation/growth  sites for Al 3 Li phase, resulting  in a ‘composite’  pre- 
cipitation  [1] . This phenomenon  has attracted  wide attentions  from 
researchers,  for the superior  mechanical  performance  at high tem- 
peratures  due to core-shell  precipitates  [2–4] , and they concluded  
that these precipitations  were due to the segregation  of alloying  
elements  at the interface  between  the matrix and the pre-existed  
precipitates.  
In this research,  we report another  kind of core-shell  struc- 
tured precipitation  in a zirconium  based metallic  material.  Using 
transmission  electron  microscope  combined  with spectroscopy  and 
diffraction  techniques,  we have investigated  the crystallographic  
orientation  relationships  among  the matrix,  shell structure  and the 
nanoparticle.  Furthermore,  the formation  mechanism  of the shell 
structure  was discussed.

0.14%O  (in weight  percentage)  alloy was prepared  by arc melting.  
Subsequently,  the alloy button was solid solution  treated  at 1100 °C 
in furnace  with a holding  time of 1h, followed  by isothermal  forg- 
ing in reduction  of 50% at 10 0 0 °C, which was above the ( α+ β)/ β
transus  temperature,  and air cooling.  
As shown in Fig. 1 , identiﬁcation  of the nanoparticle  was ac- 
complished  through  indexing  the corresponding  selected  area elec- 
tron diffraction  (SAED)  patterns  and an energy  dispersive  spec- 
trometer  (EDS) analysis.  It was concluded  that the core structure  
was Zr 3 Ge phase (P4 2 /n, a = b = 11.07 ˚A, c = 5.47 ˚A). Interestingly,  a 
uniform  shell structure  with ∼25nm in thickness  was perfectly  en- 
circling  the nanoparticle,  and it did not display  any segregation  of 
alloying  elements  (EDS analysis  referring  to point B in Fig. 1 ). 
Based on SEAD analysis  (as shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemen-  
tary material),  the shell structure  was indexed  as face centered  
cubic (FCC) Zr (Fm 3 m, a = 4 . 93 ˚A, measured  by SAED patterns),  
obeying  the orientation  relationship:  [2 1 1 0] hcp-Zr ∥ [1 1 0] fcc-Zr ∥ [0 
3 4] Zr3Ge and (0 0 01) hcp-Zr ∥ (1 1 1) fcc-Zr ∥ ( 18 4 3 ) Zr3Ge . As shown in 
Fig. 2 , a stacking  faults region with 10nm in width was observed  
between  the shell structure  and the matrix ( Fig. 2 b and f). 
The HCP to FCC phase transformation  has been recently  ob- 
served in Ti, Zr, and Hf under straining  conditions  [5-10] . This 
transformation  typically  produces  two types of orientation  rela- 
tionships  between  the two structures,  named  by B-type and P- 
type [7] relations,  correspondingly:  (1) [2 1 1 0] hcp-Zr ∥ [1 1 0] fcc-Zr

and (0 0 01) hcp-Zr ∥ ( 1 1 1 ) fcc-Zr ; (2) [0 0 01] hcp-Zr ∥ [0 0 1] fcc-Zr and 
( 10 1 0 ) hcp-Zr ∥ (220) fcc-Zr . Obviously,  the shell structure  and matrix 
obeyed  B-type orientation  relationship.  The B-type HCP-FCC  trans- 
formation  was mainly  driven by Shockley  partial dislocations  with 
Burgers  vectors  of the 1/3 ⟨ 1 0 1 0 ⟩ type, which were generated  and 
glided on every other (0 0 01) hcp-Zr plane during transformation  [7] . 
During  this transformation,  the process  of ...AB ABAB AB... sequence  
converting  to ...AB CABC AB... required  shifting  of sequences  in at 
least four crystal planes (layers),  as marked  by underlines.  How- 
ever, in earlier researches,  only partial dislocations  were observed  at the HCP/FCC  interface,  instead  of a stacking  faults region.  Thus, 
the interface  between  the FCC shell structure  and HCP matrix was 
further  analyzed.  
The interplanar  spacing  along the [0 0 01] hcp-Zr direction  in the 
matrix and shell structure  were different:  2.79 ˚A for (0 0 01) hcp-Zr 
increased  to 2.85 ˚A for ( 1 1 1 ) fcc-Zr , corresponding  to a transforma-  
tion strain of 2.15%. As a result, the HCP matrix was subjected  
to an effective  tension  along the [0 0 01] hcp-Zr direction  during the 
HCP to FCC transformation.  Once the FCC shell structure  formed,  
it changed  the local strain distribution  due to the crystal expan-

sion [11] . With the help of geometric  phase analysis  (GPA), quan- 
titative  strain maps at the region containing  the matrix,  stacking  
faults region and shell structure  were generated  and analyzed.  The 
local strain components  ( εxx and εyy ) were calculated  by analyz-  
ing the derivative  of two-dimensional  displacement  ﬁeld, based on 
HR-TEM  images  [12] . The region marked  by yellow frame in Fig. 3 
(e) was deﬁned  as a reference  region with zero strain. We found 
that there was large strain along the X direction  in the stacking  
faults region,  which was also portrayed  in the horizontal  intensity  
linescans  results ( Fig. 3 g). However,  enervate  strains along Y di- 
rection  were detected  ( Fig. 3 h). As discussed  above, the B-type 
transformation  was driven by gliding  of partial dislocations  along 
(0 0 01) hcp-Zr planes in the matrix,  resulting  in the shifting  of planar 
sequences  along the [0 0 01] hcp-Zr direction.  In other words, during 
the HCP-FCC  transformation,  the atomic  distances  along the Y di- 
rection  did not alter. Thus, the εyy strain at the transition  zones 
(the stacking  faults region)  between  the two structures  was much 
less than the εxx values. According  to a ﬁrst-principles  study of 
stacking  faults in HCP metals,  the stacking  fault energy  (SFE) of 
the (0 0 01) hcp-Zr plane was lower among  the close-packed  crystal 
planes in HCP-Zr  [13] . In other words, stacking  faults were prefer- 
entially  observed  among  basal planes.  In this research,  the faulted  
crystal planes in the stacking  faults region were parallel  to both 
(0 0 01) hcp-Zr and ( 1 1 1 ) fcc-Zr planes,  which was in perfectly  agree- 
ment with the theoretical  calculations.  In other words, the rela- 
tively low stacking  fault energy  had promoted  the B-type HCP- 
FCC structure  transformation  and the stacking  faults region.  For 
the interface  between  FCC-Zr and Zr 3 Ge precipitate,  the interfaci-  
cal structure  was highly incoherent:  [1 1 0] fcc-Zr ∥ [0 3 4] Zr3Ge and 
( 1 1 1 ) fcc-Zr ∥ ( 18 4 3 ) Zr3Ge , which failed to activate  a group of parallel  
partial dislocations.  Thus, no stacking  faults region were observed  
between  the FCC-Zr and Zr 3 Ge phase. 
Based on TEM characterization  for multiple  specimens,  the 
core-shell  precipitates  were only observed  at grain boundaries  (as 
shown in Figure S2 and S3 in the supplementary  material).  Till 
now, FCC-Zr phase observed  in the interior  were all resulted  from 
plastic deformation  at room temperature  [5–11] , which produces  
the driving  force for the HCP-FCC  phase transformation.  In this re- 
search,  the alloy went through  isothermal  forging  followed  by air 
cooling,  which failed to provide  driving  force for intracrystalline  HCP-FCC  phase transformation.  According  to our research  [14] , the 
dragging  force between  nanoprecipitates  and grain boundary  could 
lead to phase transformations  in zirconium  alloy. Thus, the grain 
boundary  dragging  effect could be one of the prerequisites  for the 
core-shell  structured  precipitates.  As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the grain 
boundary  near the nanoparticle  was curved due to the pinning  ef- 
fect. As a result, dragging  force (F) was applied  to the nanoparticle  
and it could be calculated  by: 
F = F Z 
S 
π( 1 + 2 . 14 ε ) 
ε 1 / 2 ( ε ≥1 ) (1) 
F S = 2 πrγsin θcos (π
2 −α+ θ)
(2) 
γAP −γBP = γcos α (3) 
where A and B refer to grains at each side of the grain boundary;  
γis the boundary  surface  tension,  containing  two particle/surface  
tensions  γAP and γBP ; θis the bypass angle and γAP −γBP = γ
cos α; εis the aspect (ratio between  major axis ‘b’ and minor 
axis ‘a’) of the ellipsoidal  particle;  F S is the dragging  force from a 
spherical  particle  of the same volume  [15] . For the same nanaopar-  
ticle, there were two cases for the interaction  (case 1 and case 
2 shown in Fig. 4 c): in case 1, the dragging  force increased  
with the aspect;  in case 2, the dragging  force decreased  with the 
aspect.  In this research,  the interaction  between  the nanoparti-  
cle and grain boundary  was similar  to case 1, resulting  in rela- 
tively lower dragging  force. According  to the Fig. 4 (b), this di- 
rection  was nearly parallel  to the close-packed  (0 0 01) hcp-Zr planes,  
but angled from the close-packed  plane of the Zr 3 Ge nanoparti-  
cle. Thus, B-type HCP-FCC  phase transformation  was preferentially  
activated.
