The growth in the interest  and research  on high-entropy  alloys (HEAs) over the last decade is due to their 
unique material  phases responsible  for their remarkable  structural  properties.  A conventional  approach  to 
discovering  new HEAs requires  scavenging  an enormous  search space consisting  of over half a trillion new 
material  compositions  comprising  of three to six principal  elements.  Machine  learning  has emerged  as a 
potential  tool to rapidly accelerate  the search for and design of new materials,  due to its rapidity,  scala- 
bility, and now, reasonably  accurate  material  property  predictions.  Here, we implement  machine  learning  
tools, to predict the crystallographic  phase and Young’s  modulus  of low-, medium-  and high-entropy  al- 
loys composed  of a family of 5 refractory  elements.  Our results, in conjunction  with experimental  valida- 
tion, reveal that the mean melting  point and electronegativity  difference  exert the strongest  contributions  
to the phase formation  in these alloys, while the melting  temperature  and the enthalpy  of mixing are the 
key features  impacting  the Young’s  modulus  of these materials.  Additionally,  and more importantly,  we 
ﬁnd that the entropy  of mixing only negligibly  inﬂuences  the phase or the Young’s  modulus,  reigniting  
the issue of its actual impact on the material  phase and properties  of HEAs.

High-entropy  alloys (HEAs)  are compositionally  complex  alloys 
containing  multiple  principal  elements  in near equiatomic  propor-  
tions, and have received  widespread  attention  due to their promis-  
ing structural  properties  [1–5] . The underlying  principle  is that for 
5 or more elements,  the high conﬁgurational  entropy  potentially  
overcomes  the enthalpy  of mixing  and prevents  phase separation  
or the formation  of compounds  [6] . While Cantor et al. [7] reported  
that CrCoFeMnNi  assumes  a single phase FCC solid solution,  pres- 
ence of multiple  phases has been noted for other HEAs [2] . Typi- 
cally, a single phase solid solution  (SS) contributes  to excellent  me- 
chanical  properties  [8] , while ductility  deteriorates  in the presence  
of intermetallics  that are inherently  brittle [9] . Thus, knowledge  of 
the HEA phase serves as an indicator  of its material  properties.  
Fundamentally,  lowering  the Gibbs free energy  of mixing  
( /Delta1G mix ) in /Delta1G mix = /Delta1H mix −T /Delta1S mix stabilizes  the alloy. Here, 
T is the absolute  temperature,  /Delta1H mix is the enthalpy  of mixing,  
/Delta1S mix = −R ∑ n 
i =1 ( C i ln C i ) is the entropy  of mixing  [10] , R the gas 
constant  and C i is the atomic  fraction  of the i th component  in 
the alloy. It has been proposed  that for a solid solution  to form, 
/Omega1> 1, while intermetallic  compounds  would likely form if /Omega1< 1, 
where /Omega1= T m /Delta1S mix

i =1 C i ( 1 −r i

of atomic  size differences  between  the principal  elements  ( ¯r is the 
average  atomic  radius and r i is the atomic  radius of the i th compo-  
nent) [12] . From /Omega1and δpredictions  for over 130 alloys available  
in the literature,  it has been reported  that a solid solution  forms 
when /Omega1> 1 and δ≤6.6 %. Along the same lines, an earlier report 
[13] suggested  that the conditions  of −22 kJ

perfect  lattice and δ2 is analogous  to strain energy,  was found to 
favor the formation  of disordered  solid solution  [14] . In particu-  
lar, λ> 0.96 indicated  single phase disordered  solid solutions,  two 
phase mixtures  for 0.24 < λ< 0.96, while compound  formation  
was predicted  for λ< 0.24.

importance  of the material  features  for the prediction  of the spe- 
ciﬁc crystallographic  phase that any given HEA composition  may 
assume.  Here, for a range of equiatomic  low- (binary),  medium-  
(ternary,  quaternary)  and high- (quinary)  entropy  alloys composed  
of refractory  elements  (Mo-Ta-Ti-W-Zr),  we employ  gradient  boost 
algorithms  to predict  the Young’s  modulus  ( E ) and identify  the 
speciﬁc  crystallographic  phases i.e., BCC, FCC or multiphase.  The 
machine  learned  results,  as discussed  below, exhibit  remarkable  
agreement  with experimental  characterization  and measurements.  
We choose  the alloys in the Mo-Ta-Ti-W-Zr  family as a testbed,  
since a recent report has predicted  a certain  MoTaTiWZr  HEA to 
possess  an extraordinary  Young’s  modulus  of ~335 GPa [3] , supe- 
rior to commercial  alloys. Nevertheless,  the proposed  approach  is 
generic  and applicable  across a wide gamut of HEA compositions.  
Data assemblage  and feature  selection:  Available  experimental  
data is collected  from existing  literature  [2 , 4 , 15–20]  . The data for 
crystallographic  phase prediction  (‘phases  dataset’)  consists  of 329 
entries  where 159 are BCC HEAs, 111 are FCC HEAs and 59 are mul- 
tiphase.  Since there are relatively  smaller  number  of HCP HEAs dis- 
cussed in the literature,  we do not include  them in ‘phases  dataset’  
to avoid creating  a biased dataset  that reduces  the accuracy  of 
the predictive  model [16] . The ‘multiphase’  label in the phase pre- 
diction  model indicates  that the alloy is not a single phase solid 
solution  and could exhibit  a secondary  phase or an intermetal-  
lic phase. It does not indicate  a mixture  of FCC and BCC as the 
‘phases  dataset’  used for training  the crystallographic  phase pre- 
diction  model had L1 2 and B 2 precipitates  in the multiphase  alloy 
data. The dataset  for Young’s  modulus  (‘E-dataset’)  consists  of only 
87 entries  due to limited  experimental  reports.  The datasets  have 
been executed  using the Jupyter  Notebook  [17] as a DataFrame.  The 
features  that have been adopted  for the crystallographic  phase pre- 
diction  are listed in Table 1 . T m is an indirect  measure  of strength  
of interatomic  interactions  [18] , while a m is reﬂective  of the metal- 
lic bonding  strength.  We additionally  include  /Delta1T m as a measure  
of difference  in magnitudes  of atomic  interactions,  and /Delta1a as a 
measure  of the degree of incongruence  of the combining  lattices.  
A low /Delta1T m and /Delta1a would facilitate  atoms of different  metals to 
combine  into a single lattice. For the Young’s  modulus  dataset,  the 
features  /Delta1T m and /Delta1a have not been included,  and has been dis- 
cussed below where in Fig. 3 (b) it is seen that one of the fea- 
tures, a m (lattice  constant  calculated  by the rule of mixtures),  has 
a negligible  impact  in determining  the Young’s  modulus.  Based on 
this observation,  it is redundant  to include  /2206a (difference  in lattice 
constants)  as an additional  feature.  Moreover,  the ‘phases  dataset’  does contain  both the /Delta1T m and /Delta1a as features.  This concept  stems 
from the fundamental  principle  of single phase solid solution  for- 
mation  [19 , 20] that emphasizes  on calculating  the ‘concentration  
averaged  difference’  in parameters  like electronegativity  or atomic  
size when describing  HEAs because  the latter do not have a sin- 
gle dominant  solvent  or a solute [21] . Hence, /Delta1T m and /Delta1a are in- 
cluded for predicting  the formation  of single phase solid solutions  
and not for predicting  the Young’s  modulus.  Note that /Delta1χ(differ-  
ence in Pauling  electronegativities)  is not analogous  to the valence  
electron  concentration  (VEC) for metals per se but it is closely  re- 
lated to the electron  aﬃnity  and VEC; it can be used for determin-  
ing bond strengths  and atom positions  relative  to other species  in 
a matrix [22] . Hence, in this work, /Delta1χhas been used as a repre- 
sentation  of all other electronic  features  namely  VEC and electron  
aﬃnity.  Prior literature  [23] have used VEC independently  to clas- 
sify the phases formed  in HEAs by developing  empirical  models  
that suggest  formation  of FCC, when VEC ≥8.0; formation  of BCC 
when VEC ≤6.87 and formation  of mixed FCC and BCC phases 
otherwise.  This empirical  model has been tried in the current  work 
and discussed  below, but yields limited  success.  
Data analysis  is initially  performed  by calculating  the Pearson  
correlation  coeﬃcient  P [24] using a heat map illustrated  in Fig. 
1 . Here, P = 1 denotes  strong positive  correlation  and P = –1 de- 
notes a strong negative  correlation.  The absence  of any signiﬁcant  
correlation  amongst  any pair of features  indicates  that all metrics  
should be considered  in the model. 
Model construction:  After assembling  the data and evaluating  
the feature  values, we employ  the datasets  to construct  two ma- 
chine learning  models,  one for predicting  the Young’s  modulus  and 
the other for the crystallographic  phase. In each case, the dataset  
is classiﬁed  into a training  set (90% of the data) and a test set 
(10% of the data). For example,  in our ‘phases  dataset’,  we use 
around  296 (90%) data points for training  the model and around  
33 (10%) data points for testing the model. This process  is essential  
to build a robust model with minimum  training  error (discussed  
in following  sections)  before the model can be adopted  for actual 
usage. The errors generated  in the predictions  of the test dataset  
are quantiﬁed  and minimized  by altering  the parameters  of the 
models,  which are retrained  iteratively  on the training  data fol- 
lowed by re-predictions  on the test subset until the error is min- 
imized  below a threshold.  The model is ﬁnally used for predict-  
ing crystallographic  phases and Young’s  moduli  of alloys in Table 
2 . The ﬁnal model predictions  are validated  with experimental  
measurements.

Model for predicting  crystallographic  phase: The phase predic-  
tion is performed  by employing  the Gradient  Boost Classiﬁcation  
[25] algorithm.  This algorithm  starts with one leaf that is equal 
to the initial prediction  for every data in the phases-dataset.  This 
initial prediction  is effectively  the logarithm  (log) of the odds of 
a particular  output.  This log is calculated  by taking the log of the 
number  of favorable  outputs  over the number  of unfavorable  out- 
puts. To use this log value conveniently,  we convert  it to a prob- 
ability representation  using the logistic  function  P = e log ( od d s ) 
1+ e log( od d s ) . 
P = 0.5 is set as the threshold  value, typical of classiﬁcation  prob- 
lems, and the residuals  are calculated  and stored. For the data with 
the favorable  output,  the residual  = 1 −P and for the data with 
unfavorable  output the residual  = 0 −P . These residuals  form the 
leaves of the current  tree. The number  of leaves range between  8 
and 32; hence, if a leaf contains  more than one residual,  then it 
is replaced  by a single value called “output  from tree” that  is ob- 
tained from 
outp ut from tree 
= ∑ resi dual ∑ [ ( prev ious prob abil ity ) i ×( 1 −prev ious prob abil ity ) i ] 
Subsequently,  the log of the odds is updated  as 
log ( od d s ) = pre v ious prediction  + number of trees ∑ 
i =1 ( learning  rate ) 
×( out put  fro m tree ) 
Once the new log(odds)  value is obtained,  we again convert  it 
to a probability  ( P ) as discussed  previously.  The process  is repeated  
by calculating  the new residuals  and at every successive  step the 
residual  value is expected  to decrease  until it attains a minimum  
at the last tree. The ﬁnal probabilities  are used to classify  the data 
into favorable  or unfavorable  outputs.  
Model for predicting  Young’s  modulus:  Gradient  boost for re- 
gression  [25] is used in the model for predicting  E . The algorithm  
initiates  by building  a leaf from the training  data. This leaf resem-  
bles an initial guess for the output of all data in the dataset.  For 
instance,  the ﬁrst guess is essentially  the average  E of the entire E-dataset.  Next, the algorithm  builds a tree such that a node of the 
tree is analogous  to a conditional  loop. The conditions  are based on 
the errors from a previous  tree. Errors are deﬁned  as the pseudo  
residuals  or differences  between  the observed  and the predicted  
E . Note that when the ﬁrst tree is built, it originates  from a sin- 
gle leaf that is the mean of all E values. The maximum  number  
of leaves is set between  8 and 32. Whenever  a new tree is built, 
it calculates  the pseudo  residuals  for all the entries  in the dataset  
and is scaled by a parameter  called “learning  rate” to  avoid over- 
ﬁtting of the model to the data. The product  of the “learning  rate”
( = 0.1) and the pseudo  residual  obtained  at the end of each tree 
is the actual contribution  of that tree. The algorithm  continues  to 
build more trees until a speciﬁc  number  of tress or an improved  
ﬁt is obtained.  Given the number  of leaves is limited  between  8 
and 32, we get fewer leaves than the number  of pseudo  residuals  
(equal to the size of the dataset).  Hence, if multiple  pseudo  resid- 
uals fall under the same leaf, they are replaced  by a single average  
data point. Each successive  tree is combined  with the existing  se- 
quences  of trees, and after the required  number  of trees have been 
built we predict  
E = E mean + [ ( lear ning rate ) ×resi dual ] 1 
+ [ ( lear ning rate ) ×resi dual ] 2 + ... 
+ [ ( lear ning rate ) ×resi dual ] n 
where the subscripts  1, 2, …, n represent  the number  of the trees. 
At each successive  tree, the residual  value decreases  and reduces  
to a minimum  at the ﬁnal tree that provides  the closest prediction  
to the measurements.  
Experimental  validation:  We synthesize  26 alloys composed  
Mo-Ta-Ti-W-Zr  elements,  as listed in Table 2 , by arc-melting  com- 
pressed  pellets of elemental  powder  mixes (Sigma-Aldrich,  purity 
≥99.9%) in Argon atmosphere  (pressure  30 psi) on a water-cooled  
copper  hearth.  Powdered  metals are used to minimize  the occur- 
rences of elemental  macro-segregation  and achieve  homogeneity  in 
the alloys. Powders  are mixed thoroughly  in a laboratory  jar mill 
(Thomas  Scientiﬁc  Series 80 0 0), at an optimum  rpm to ensure a 
balance  between  the centrifugal  and gravitational  forces. Next, the

phases dataset and (b) Young’s modulus  (E) dataset, as employed  for the differ-

correlation,  respectively.  
powder  mixes are compressed  to a pressure  of 50 0 0 psi on cylin- 
drical pellets of diameter  20 mm using a Carver hydraulic  press. 
The pellets are then arc-melted  (in Edmund  Bühler GmbH Mini Arc 
Melting  System),  cooled and re-melted  a total of four times to en- 
sure improved  homogeneity.  An X-ray diffractometer  (Panalytical  
Empyrean  vs. 7.9f 20170530  X-ray Diffraction  Unit) is employed  for 
characterization  of the crystal structure,  with the 2 θscan ranging  
from 10 to 90 °, with the radiation  from a 45 kV, 40 mA copper  
target. Subsequently,  the data is analyzed  with Malvern  Panalytical  
HighScore  software  package  [26] . The alloy data in Table 2 serves 
as the validation  set for both classiﬁcation  and regression  models.  
Nanoindentation  is performed  on mounted  and polished  samples  
using a Hysitron  TI900 nanoindenter  with a Berkovich  tip. Indents  
are performed  using load control  with a maximum  load of 5 mN 
and a 5–2–5 s load-hold-unload  proﬁle.  An array of 25 indents  (5 by 5 pattern)  with a spacing  of 10 μm in the x and y was per- 
formed  on each sample.  Modulus  and hardness  are determined  us- 
ing the Oliver and Pharr method  [27] . 
Crystallographic  phase predictions:  The tunable  parameters  in 
a machine  learning  algorithm  (gradient  boost classiﬁer  in this case) 
are known  as the hyperparameters.  The hyperparameters  for gra- 
dient boost algorithm  are predominantly  “learning  rate” and  “n- 
estimators” [25 , 28] . These hyperparameters  can be set to an opti- 
mum value while training  the algorithm  on the dataset,  to eventu-  
ally produce  minimum  training  error. Here, 90% of the data from 
training  set is employed  to train the model and the remaining  10% 
is used as a test set to check for error in prediction.  We deﬁne 
error as 
error = numb er of inco rrect pred icti ons 
total numb er of data poin ts 
The error is calculated  for all possible  combinations  of 15 
“learning  rate” values  ranging  from 0.001 to 0.5 and 15 “n- 
estimators” ranging  from 50 to 10 0 0. Fig. 2 illustrates  the hyper- 
parameters’  optimization  (the process  of the guiding  the hyperpa-  
rameters  to an optimum  value) to minimize  error. A learning  rate 
of 0.05–0.2  with 450–600  estimators  produces  a minimum  error 
of 0.3077 as identiﬁed  in region R in Fig. 2 (a). Thus, any set of hy- 
perparameter  values within that range can be considered  for the 
ﬁnal model. Here, the learning  rate is set to 0.1 and n-estimators  
is set to 500. The output produced  by the model after the exper- 
imental  dataset  for the 26 alloys, is listed in Table 2 . On com- 
parison  between  the measured  and predicted  values for crystallo-  
graphic  phases,  our model is able to accurately  identify  the lattice 
structure  of 14 out of the possible  23 alloys (the crystal structure  
test data contains  3 alloys that form HCP lattices,  and our exist- 
ing model can predict  only FCC, BCC or a mix of FCC and BCC). 
The empirical  model [23] for determining  phases using VEC seems 
to be of limited  accuracy  because  all alloys in this study show 
a VEC ≤6 ( Table 2 ) which categorizes  them all as BCC phase. 
Hence, the empirical  model cannot be guaranteed  to yield correct  
results when applied  to a refractory  system  such as the one under 
investigation.  
Young’s  moduli  predictions:  We deﬁne the mean absolute  error 
as mean absolute  error = ∑ n 
i =1 | y i −x i | 
n , where y i is the prediction  and 
x i is the measured  Young’s  modulus  from experiments,  while n is 
the total number  of data points available.  From the hyperparam-  
eter optimization  illustrated  in Fig. 2 (b), we ﬁnd that a learning  
rate of 0.0031 and n-estimators  of 10 0 0 produces  the minimum  
mean absolute  error of 23.59 GPa, and consequently  adopt that for 
the ﬁnal model. The model output reveals  that 19 of the 26 predic-  
tions are within an error of 20%, while 14 are within a 12% margin.  
We strongly  assert that the accuracy  is limited  by the sparse data 
available  to us, and will improve  as the additional  simulation  and 
experimental  results are incorporated  into training  the model. In 
the current  state of the model, the root-mean  square error (RMSE)  
for this regression  model was calculated  to be 87.76%.  
The relative  importance  of the different  features  in the structure  
and modulus  predictions  are illustratively  compared  in Fig. 3 . For 
crystallographic  phase prediction,  the order of feature  importance  
is noted to be T m > /Delta1χ> /Delta1T m > a m > /Omega1> /Delta1H mix > /Delta1a > 
λ> /Delta1S mix > δ, while for Young’s  modulus,  we ﬁnd the order to 
be T m > /Delta1H mix > λ> /Omega1> /Delta1χ> δ> /Delta1S mix > a m . These results 
evince that certain  descriptors  like T m and /Delta1H mix are more cru- 
cial than the Hume-Rothery  parameters  ( /Delta1χand δ) in determin-  
ing the Young’s  modulus,  while T m , /Delta1χ, /Delta1T m are key in estimating  
the phases that form in these multicomponent  alloys. 
T m and /Delta1χare predicted  to be the key parameters  in deter- 
mining  the alloy phases.  Since a high T m of the alloying  elements  
is analogous  to their high bonding  energies,  the constituent  metal 
with the highest  melting  temperature  would preferably  not allow

the inclusion  of another  metal atom with a lower bonding  energy  
and hence the system  would form multiple  phases.  On the other 
hand, the difference  in electronegativity  is directly  responsible  for 
the probability  of intermetallic  compound  (secondary  phases)  for- 
mation.  /Delta1T m plays a vital role in determining  phases as it conveys  
information  on relative  bond strengths  of the metals in the alloys; 
the lower the /Delta1T m , the higher is the probability  of the formation  
of single phase as the metallic  bond strengths  in each metal will 
be identical.  /Delta1a and a m exhibit  strong contribution  in determining  
the phases,  relative  to /Delta1S mix , as similar  lattice parameters  enable 
the formation  of single phase to be more probable.  Interestingly,  
contrary  to the Hume-Rothery  guidelines  and an earlier report [11] , 
our machine  learned  model identiﬁes  δto be the least decisive  fea- 
ture in determining  single phase formation  in the equiatomic  al- 
loys. While /Omega1plays a considerable  role in determining  the phase, 
λand /Delta1S mix can be regarded  as insigniﬁcant  features  for predict-  
ing the crystallographic  phases.  Our results conclusively  suggest  that melting  point of alloys, 
which is an indirect  metric of bond strength  [18] , signiﬁcantly  in- 
ﬂuences  the Young’s  modulus.  Likewise,  since a high negative  mix- 
ing enthalpy  and a high electronegativity  difference  enhances  the 
probability  of the formation  of intermetallics  that are brittle and 
have low E values, /Delta1H mix and /Delta1χplay a signiﬁcant  role in esti- 
mating  the Young’s  modulus  of the alloys [29] . While the thermo-  
dynamic  parameters,  λand /Omega1, exert a considerable  inﬂuence  on 
the Young’s  modulus  predictions,  we note that the contribution  of 
the entropy  of mixing  is rather insigniﬁcant  as it provides  no fun- 
damental  measure  for the bond strengths.  The mean lattice con- 
stant obtained  from the rule of mixture,  has negligible  effect on 
Young’s  modulus.  
In summary,  we employ  available  data and experimental  mea- 
surements  to construct  machine-learned  correlations  to predict  the 
Young’s  modulus  and crystallographic  phase of low-, medium-  and 
high-entropy  alloys. Thermodynamic,  geometric  and phenomeno-

logical parameters  are chosen  as features  and the ﬁnal models  
are built to enable predictions  for 26 equiatomic  alloys in Mo-Ta-  
Ti-W-Zr  elemental  family. There is good agreement  between  the 
model predictions  and the experimental  results,  which corroborate  
that additional  material  features,  apart from the Hume-Rothery  pa- 
rameters,  contribute  signiﬁcantly  in predicting  the crystallographic  
phase and Young’s  modulus  of low-, medium-  and high-entropy  al- 
loys. A key insight  lies in the insigniﬁcant  effect of the entropy  of 
mixing  as a feature  for structure  and property  predictions,  even for 
the HEAs.
