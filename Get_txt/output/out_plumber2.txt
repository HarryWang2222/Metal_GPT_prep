ing the Oliver and Pharr method [27] . 
Crystallographic phase predictions: The tunable parameters in 
a machine learning algorithm (gradient boost classiﬁer in this case) 
are known as the hyperparameters. The hyperparameters for gra- 
dient boost algorithm are predominantly “learning rate” and “n- 
estimators” [25 , 28] . These hyperparameters can be set to an opti- 
mum value while training the algorithm on the dataset, to eventu- 
ally produce minimum training error. Here, 90% of the data from 
training set is employed to train the model and the remaining 10% 
is used as a test set to check for error in prediction. We deﬁne 
error as 
numbe r of inco rrect predi cti ons 
error = 
total numbe r of data point s 
The error is calculated for all possible combinations of 15 
“learning rate” values ranging from 0.001 to 0.5 and 15 “n- 
estimators” ranging from 50 to 10 0 0. Fig. 2 illustrates the hyper- 
parameters’ optimization (the process of the guiding the hyperpa- 
rameters to an optimum value) to minimize error. A learning rate 
of 0.05–0.2 with 450–600 estimators produces a minimum error 
of 0.3077 as identiﬁed in region R in Fig. 2 (a). Thus, any set of hy- 
perparameter values within that range can be considered for the 
ﬁnal model. Here, the learning rate is set to 0.1 and n-estimators 
is set to 500. The output produced by the model after the exper- 
imental dataset for the 26 alloys, is listed in Table 2 . On com- 
parison between the measured and predicted values for crystallo- 
graphic phases, our model is able to accurately identify the lattice 
structure of 14 out of the possible 23 alloys (the crystal structure 
test data contains 3 alloys that form HCP lattices, and our exist- 
ing model can predict only FCC, BCC or a mix of FCC and BCC). 
The empirical model [23] for determining phases using VEC seems 
to be of limited accuracy because all alloys in this study show 
a VEC  ≤ 6 ( Table 2 ) which categorizes them all as BCC phase. 
Hence, the empirical model cannot be guaranteed to yield correct 
results when applied to a refractory system such as the one under 
investigation. 
Young’s moduli predictions: We deﬁne the mean absolute error 
as mean absolute error = (cid:2) ni = 1 n| y  i −x i | , where y i is the prediction and 
x i is the measured Young’s modulus from experiments, while n is 
the total number of data points available. From the hyperparam- 
eter optimization illustrated in Fig. 2 (b), we ﬁnd that a learning 
rate of 0.0031 and n-estimators of 10 0 0 produces the minimum 
mean absolute error of 23.59 GPa, and consequently adopt that for 
the ﬁnal model. The model output reveals that 19 of the 26 predic-
